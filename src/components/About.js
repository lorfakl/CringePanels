            <p className="text-center text-wrap py-4">Based out of Charlotte North Carolina, we started doing panels in 2023(at Triadcon) with a random panel about video game development. 
                Since then, we have been trying to do as many panels as possible in the southeast region. With the goal of becoming the best panelists. </p>

                            I am Kaleb Jahad, the main host of any Kaizen Panels Production. Panel concepts from right from my dome. Started doing this because, ever since 
                            my first Ichibancon 2014 I've loved the panels, literally my favorite thing so Im just trying to put on productions in which people have a good time. 
                            With an eye on doing panels in ways I've never seen before.

                            This is Kaizen Panel's Chief Organizational Officer, Merry Mallan. The reason why any of these panels happen or even exist is thanks to her. She does everything, 
                            from booking rooms, to making sure panel submissions are sent in on time. Without Kaizen Panels would be NOTHING!
                            So if its at the panels or if you see her around the convention hall be sure to thank her. She likes frogs and Shrek

                            This is Kaizen Panel's Artistic Director, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pen.saga/" className="underline underline-offset-4">Pen.Saga</a>. Everything you see here, the banner, the favicon, even the colors all from his brain.  
                            Everything you see in the panels, was either touched by him or approved by him. I am not good at PowerPoint. Sometimes he's even in the artist alley and conventions we're at
                            so be sure to stop by check out his non-panel related art.
